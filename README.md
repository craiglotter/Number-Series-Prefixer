Number Series Prefixer
======================

Number Series Prefixer is a simple application that simply parses through a text-based file, prefixing all lines with a specified number series.

For example, a text file containing:

aaa
bbb

Would become (with a number series starting at 1 with a length of 2 characters and a single space character):

01 aaa
02 bbb
